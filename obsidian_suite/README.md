# Obsidian MCP for Home Assistant

**One Home Assistant add-on for private ChatGPT access to Obsidian notes and optional LiveSync replication.**

## Features

The add-on combines three supervised processes:

1. **Markdown MCP Server**: list, search, read, create, append, rename and recoverably delete Markdown files in a local Obsidian vault.
2. **OpenAI Secure MCP Tunnel**: connect an authorized ChatGPT workspace to the local MCP endpoint without public port forwarding.
3. **Self-hosted LiveSync CLI**: synchronize that vault with an existing CouchDB-backed Obsidian LiveSync setup.

It reuses files in Home Assistant's persistent `/app_configs/obsidian_bridge` directory. The MCP server starts before the tunnel client.

## Requirements

- **Home Assistant OS or Supervised (amd64)** with access to add-on installation.
- **An existing Markdown Obsidian vault stored on Home Assistant**, at `/app_configs/obsidian_bridge/vault`.
- **A working CouchDB / Self-hosted LiveSync server** (for example an independently installed Obsidian Sync Server add-on) and a valid LiveSync CLI settings file, if LiveSync is enabled. Installing this add-on does **not** install CouchDB, the Obsidian client app, or the sync server.
- **An authorized OpenAI tunnel ID, tunnel-client binary and runtime key**, if the tunnel is enabled.
- **A compatible ChatGPT workspace** with permission to use the tunnel.

The current release supports existing, provisioned installations. **A fresh installation requires manually placing the vault, LiveSync settings and tunnel credentials in their documented private locations.** Do not start two LiveSync writers against the same vault or two clients sharing the same tunnel identity.
